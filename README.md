Stock Price Predictor

The Stock Price Predictor is a Flask web application that allows users to predict the future price of a given stock using historical data. The app leverages machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices one year into the future. Additionally, it provides visualizations of historical prices, predicted future prices, and various analytical plots to help users understand the stock's behavior.

The motivation behind this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for investors and stock enthusiasts to gain insights into the future trends of stock prices. By using historical data and machine learning models, this app aims to make stock price predictions more accessible to the general public.

This project addresses the need for an accessible tool that helps users make informed decisions about their stock investments by providing future price predictions and visual analyses of stock trends.
